# Diffusional Kurtosis Estimator
The Diffusional Kurtosis Estimator (DKE) is software for processing 
Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) data. 

DKE is written primarily in MATLAB. It can be run either from executables 
or from source code. An advantage of running DKE from executables is that 
it can be run under the free MATLAB Compiler Runtime 2012a (MCR), whereas 
MATLAB is needed for running DKE from source code. An advantage of running 
DKE from source code is that you can modify your copy of the source code 
to suit your own purposes.

The DKE executables for 32- and 64-bit Windows, 64-bit Linux, and 64-bit macOS 
can be downloaded from the MUSC CBI website. If you want to run DKE this way 
[click here to register to download DKE executables](http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/cbi/dki/dke-swreg.html).

The source code can be downloaded from this site using either the Downloads menu 
or via "git clone". For example, at the Linux or macOS command prompt:
```
$ git clone git@git.musc.edu:dal220/dke.git
```
If you download DKE via "git clone", you can later update to the latest 
version on this site with "git pull":
```
$ git pull
```
